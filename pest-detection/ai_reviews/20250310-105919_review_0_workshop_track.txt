    "Summary": "The paper investigates the challenges and limitations of deploying deep learning models for pest detection in real-world agricultural settings. It identifies key issues such as data quality, environmental variability, and model limitations. The study employs various experiments, including learning rate optimization and multi-dataset training, to understand these challenges better. The findings suggest that while optimizing learning rates can improve model performance, significant problems remain related to robustness and generalization.",
