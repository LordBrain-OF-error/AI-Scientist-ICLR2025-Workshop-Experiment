    "Summary": "The paper investigates the challenges hindering the generalization of deep learning models for pest detection in real-world agricultural settings, focusing on data quality, environmental variability, and inherent model limitations. Through experiments involving learning rate optimization and multi-dataset training, the authors demonstrate that while lower learning rates can enhance generalization, models still struggle with robustness to environmental changes.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses a practical and important problem in precision agriculture.",
        "Provides a thorough analysis of the impact of learning rates on model performance.",
        "Includes an exploration of multi-dataset training and its effects on model generalization.",
        "The use of Environmental Robustness Score (ERS) to quantify the model's robustness to environmental changes is a novel metric."
