    "Summary": "The paper investigates the impact of label noise on model calibration in deep learning. Through controlled experiments on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) with synthetic label noise, the study reveals that label noise, particularly asymmetric noise, leads to overconfident and miscalibrated predictions. The effectiveness of existing label noise mitigation techniques is evaluated, showing limited improvements, thus highlighting the need for new methods to enhance model reliability despite noisy labels.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper addresses a significant and underexplored issue in deep learning: the impact of label noise on model calibration.",
        "The methodology is rigorous, involving controlled experiments on standard datasets.",
        "The findings are novel and important, revealing the detrimental impact of label noise on model calibration.",
        "The paper is well-organized and clearly written.",
        "The study provides comprehensive experimentation, including the use of controlled synthetic label noise and evaluation of calibration metrics like ECE and reliability diagrams."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "The study is limited to three datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST), which may not be representative of all real-world scenarios.",
        "The paper evaluates only a few standard mitigation techniques, and more advanced methods could be explored.",
        "The discussion on potential negative societal impacts is limited.",
        "The methodology section lacks detailed explanations, particularly regarding the injection of synthetic label noise and the training procedure.",
        "The paper could benefit from additional ablation studies, for example, varying the training procedures or model architectures to see if the findings hold."
