    "Summary": "The paper investigates the challenge of enhancing compositional generalization in neural networks by introducing a compositional regularization term into the training loss. The authors hypothesized that this would encourage the network to form compositional representations, thereby improving generalization to unseen combinations of arithmetic expressions. However, the experiments revealed that compositional regularization did not lead to the expected improvements and, in some cases, hindered the learning process. The paper provides a thorough analysis of these unexpected outcomes and discusses potential reasons for the failure.",
